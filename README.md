A simple CLI utility suite to inspect Hugging Face repositories, evaluate local disk space safety, and check model trends.

---

## 🛑 About 

1. **`diskspace` (Preventing Storage Crashes):** Stops you from downloading a model that will crash your hard drive halfway through. It checks the remote model size against your remaining local storage before you download.
2. **`vibecheck` (Evaluating Project Activity):** Checks monthly downloads, community likes, and lifecycle metrics so you can immediately see if a model is vibrant and maintained or a dormant archive.
3. **`peek` (Inspecting Model Architecture):** Avoids downloading heavy model weights just to check basic parameters. It instantly snatches and parses the remote `config.json` to show context windows, attention heads, and model classes.
